  <summary>the prompt in text</summary>
  am practicing my English vocabulary by writing example phrases for unfamiliar words. Please review my phrase for any mistakes in word usage, grammar, or uncommon phrasing. Only correct these mistakes without changing anything else in my example, so I can compare my original sentence to your corrections directly. Each example is unrelated to others, so please donâ€™t reference or include anything from previous messages. I will include the new word in the format below:<br><br>

  word: [the unfamiliar word I am learning]  
  example: [An example containing the 'word'].
