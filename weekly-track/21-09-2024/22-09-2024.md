### Listening

#### My Mistakes
>[!success] Underline highlighted info by speaker in your notes

During listening when you hear an information is being reiterated (by explaining the meaning, a showcase, a strong high rise in voice, pause, etc), I should ***underline the highlighted info on my notes***!. The reason is that I will forget sometimes what was highlighted by the speaker.

When answering questions, check if any answer is within the highlighted notes. Usually, when there is an highlighted topic in a choices of a question, and there is doubt, that key information is critical on determining the answer. 

>[!example] TPO002, Listening, Lecture1, Q3
>I wrote "voicebox" in parentheses right next to Laryngeal, but never made it bolder/underline, etc to show it was a key info since the speaker pointed this out obviously. Then during the answer, I had two choices, and was doubtful. If I had highlighted the critical info, I just could see that one choice (Laryngeal) is about another topic, while other choice is more relevant. 
>>[!warning]
>>Because I didn't highlight any key info, I treated all the possible choices in the same manner. (while there was a key info that could have given more/less value to a choice.)

>[!success] In answering list of ***radio buttons*** questions, all rows/qs must have an answer
>Don't confuse this with list of ***checkboxes***. In list of checkboxes, only a subset of checkboxes must be selected. In list of radio buttons, all list items (questions) must have one radio button assigned to them.
>

For example, if we have a table that has two columns of *included*, and *not included* as radio buttons, if an answer is *not included*, you should tick the button. This seems obvious, but if you get checkbox questions a lot, you might think you should answer this question in the same way as them.
>[!danger] Don't get conditioned by the type of questions

Not answering a question marks the entire response as failed.
