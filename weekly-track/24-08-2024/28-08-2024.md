## Skill Books
### Vocab

#### Word Attack Skills
- **Word Roots**: Create flash cards of roots. One side contains the root and an example word for it. The other side contains the meaning of the root and a synonym for the word containing the root.
>[!warning]
>I think it is not much helpful for an exam. You won't have time to split the word into roots, remember what the root means (particularly the meaning itself doesn't necessarily directly relate the original word), and figure out the meaning.
>As the author himself said in spending time for vocab to analysis is a wrong action (see [[27-08-2024#^bfbbb8|vocab techniques are time consuming]])  ^658373

- **Prefix**: Since prefixes usually have very smaller category and sort of can be attached to any word, learning them easy. Also, their meaning directly translates to the word meaning, so in contrary to the [[#^658373|word roots]] no guessing is inolved. (learning via flash card similar to word roots.)

- **Suffix**: the meaning is often ***grammatical***, telling us the ***tense*** or the ***function*** of
the word. (Learning the same as previous items)
