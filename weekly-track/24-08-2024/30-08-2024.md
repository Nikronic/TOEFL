## Skills

### Reading

#### Instructions
For the "summary" question, if you are stuck between two choices, see which one **is closer to the big picture** of the passage (TPO_002-Reading-Q39). So, if an entry is not close to the main concept carried by the author, then that's not the choice we are looking for.

>[!success] Given line of summary is the core concept
>Although you might have read the entire passage, there is a key to get the core idea of the passage. ***The first sentence given by the test itself is the main idea.*** So, check if the choices are aligned with it in a big picture. 

>[!note] Why do I care?
>You can ask this question when reviewing choices. What we care is the main idea in the first sentence. Do we care about a small details? No.

>[!note] Your summary should be cohesive and consistent
>After filling all the choices, if you want to make sure it is correct, reread the summary you have constructed for ***cohesion and consistency.*** 
>
>>[!warning] You get one wrong; so DO review
>>Since I always get one entry wrong in the summary question, it is a great idea to do this review process with consideration of *cohesion and consistency*. Almost all the time, *I have chosen the detailed answer instead of big picture*. So, I just need to compare the selected choices to the overall flow of the summary and see if somewhere we got a choice that is too specific or an outlier.

#### My mistakes
1. There is no point in reading questions first; just respect the question order.
2. For the "fill in the blank" questions, you should also read the last/first of the previous/next paragraph if the "blank" is at the first/last part of the paragraph in question (TPO_001-Reading-Q13).
3. The "summary" question must have an **exact match**, otherwise the entire score will be deducted.
>[!note]
>The order doesn't matter. Only choices should exist.
