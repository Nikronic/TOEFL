General tips:
- Not answering is penalized; same as answering wrong, so make sure to choose something
- if you must *guess at absolutely random*, choose **(B) or (C)**, since they are slightly more likely than (A) or (D) to be the correct response. *I pesonally disagree!*.
- Because the iBT requires a greater variety of response formats, ***always read the directions*** for each test item carefully. Ask yourself, "**What do I need to do here?**"
- ***No watches*** are allowed, even analog.
- If it seems obvious to you that you won't have enough time for a section, GUESS (B) or (C).
- Practice the testing circumstances.

## Skill Books
### Reading

#### Vocab
Each TOEFL vocabulary item refers you to a word (or phrase, such as a two-word verb) in a specific line of the passage.

So, use the following technique for answering such questions:

>[!success]
>1. Do NOT read the sentene containing the underlied word
>>>[!warning]
>> all four of the choices make sense in the sentence and that they make use of other information given in the passage. That is why you should not read the sentence before seeing the answer choices.
>3. Look at the underlined word and ***choose its synonym*** from among the four choices
>4. See if the ***synonym makes sense*** in the sentence

>[!danger] Do not use these techniques unless clueless
>Before reading the following points, make sure that you only and only are using these when you have zero clue what to choose. 

Using these techniques are time consuming and also make you doubt your own skills. So I highly suggest ignoring all of them, unless you are absolutely clueless, and have time so you can reject some choice with these techniques and increase your chances. ^bfbbb8

>[!note] Less likely answers
>1. Answer choices that contain the ***same prefix or suffix***; e.g., if underlined word is "controvers==ial==", the answer is not something like "adversar==ial=="
>2. ***Pronounced*** like the underlined word

#### Summary

>[!success]
>Summary choices are ***in order***, which means, ***see if the choice is 1) relevant, 2) core part*** of passage. You don't need to actually read all choices and just go linearly from one to another.
