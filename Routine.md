# The Study Methodology
The following is a chronological order of studying English for TOEFL exam.

## The Methodology

>[!success] This guideline is not time-based, rather task-based. 

This prevents from moving slowly, as task-based definition based on the standard content (book chapters, reading passages, etc.) allows for:
- faster learning as we don't try to pretend we studies for a couple of hours, 
- also better rewarding as we get a reward every time we finish a task (e.g., a lesson of a book).
- Finally, we can estimate the review time needed closing to the deadline. 

>[!success] Vocab is all you need; just integrate all task in vocab learning

I believe studying skill-based (the four skills tested in the test), are not optimal for one who is preparing for a test. I think, all skills come as a package when putting the vocab as the core of learning. But how?

When reading vocab, you don't just try to learn the meaning, you also learn the synonyms, collocations, and obviously study examples. And you are better of writing some examples on your own. This way, not only you have learned a couple of new words, you have learned some structure of combining different words (you implicitly learn this over time, so you don't need to actually have separate collocation list). 
Furthermore, contrary to learning grammar by learning the rules, you in fact learn who to construct different style of sentences; even paraphrasing the examples of the books allows you to implement different styles of grammar indirectly.
And finally, if you read the examples loud, and speaking the examples you have loudly, then writing it down, in fact, you are already doing speaking, writing, and reading.
And optionally, you can write a full passage (more than 300 words) for each lesson of vocab books (usually 10-20 words per lesson all related to the same topic). Then use a text-to-speech to hear what you read, or even use speech-to-text to use PC/mobile write what you speak. This way, you have integrated all skills, while you just learning a few new words per a learning session.

Of course it is needed to be reminded that doing this will take much more time (about 2-3 hours for new learners, depending on how much content you plan to study), but it is worth it as it is more exciting as you get to do different things in shorter periods rather than sticking to one skill for an entire day which becomes frustrating.

>[!note] Exception to Grammar Learning by Rules 
>Learning grammar for specific usages is possible by classical method of learning the rules. Imagine there is a specific grammar usage, e.g., "This is a good weather. Isn't it?"
>So in this case, you can learn the rule, write as many examples as you can (you can again combine it with vocab learning), and repeat this rule many many times in a one-sitting. This is similar to building muscle memory.

>>[!success] 
>>This is particularly useful for learning complex grammars that are used rarely to write more niche sentences.

>>[!warning]
>>But make sure to not have a huge gap between your general skill in using grammar and usage of these rare ones.

## Prerequisites
We need the following soft/hard needs for this:
- [[Resources#Vocab|Vocab books]]: main source of learning vocab (as the core of learning); our most important resource.
- [[Resources#All Skills Practice|Skills books]]: Books that contain examples of test scenarios and tries to teach testing skills rather than the language itself.[^1]
- [[Resources#^6239ca|Official test books]]: Books that contain official tests, but only should be used for training purposes.
- TPO software: The main tool for evaluating the progress.

## The Plan
Some constraints:
- We assume we have exactly 90 days (well I only have this much time!)
- We have around 40 lessons in *400 Must Have Words For TOEFL*, and about 30 in *Essential Words For The TOEFL*
- We must practice testing skills in *training mode*[^2]
- We must practice testing in *simulation mode*[^3]

So, here is the plan in a task-based manner:
- Study a full lesson from each of the vocab books (two lessons since two books)[^4]
	- write 1 examples per word (per meaning)
	- write a full passage for each lesson (two written passages since two books)
	- talk (speech) a full lecture for each lesson (two spoken passages since two books)
	- evaluate all stuff via ChatGPT
		- use simple prompt for examples per words
		- use complex prompt asking for TOEFL high score evaluation for both spoken and written passages
- Study a skill book
	- Don't be picky; do the tasks, take some points, document some words, that's it
- On the weekend,
	- Morning: do a full test in *training mode* (12 full exams) via *Official TOEFL iBT Tests V1 and V2* books
	- Afternoon: do a full test in a *simulation mode* (12 full exams) via TPO software
- On the final week, just review and test; nothing new should be learned.

[^1]: We Iranians are very familiar with it and we exactly know how important it is. In fact you can score high by learning skills rather than learning the language itself, particularly in *reading* and *listening* tests.
[^2]: *training mode*: The test is similar to the one in the real test, but you can use internet, stop time, check the answers, etc.
[^3]: *simulation mode*": you do the test just like the real one; it is in contrary to *training mode*, and the goal is to in fact prepare ourselves for all skill test in one sitting session.
[^4]: Do not forget to include your own personal wordlist (See [[28-08-2024#^093cab|Building Word List]])
